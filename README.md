# metabarcoding-data-processing
This script provide a full procedure of metabarcoding data generated from DNBSEQ-G400 with SE400 and PE200 modes.

Reads from the same sample can be analysed by simply following the snakemake file based on sequencing modes. OTU table can be generated after that, the rarefraction step could be taken after this analysis based on the rarefraction curve.
